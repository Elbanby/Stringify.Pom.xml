# Stringify.Pom.xml 

## About 

This tool is intended to help you speed up your maven configuration. This tool will enable
you to configure maven using JSON instead of xml. 

All what you need to do, is to specify a pom.xml file path to the cli tool, and every 
time you update the JSON file the pom.xml file will automatically be updated.
