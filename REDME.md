# Stringify.Pom.xml 

## About 

This tool is intended to help you speed up your maven configuration. This tool will enable
you to configure maven using JSON instead of xml. 

All what you need to do, is to specify a pom.xml file path to the cli tool, and every 
time you update the JSON file the pom.xml file will automatically be updated. 

### Important Notice:

This is gonna be a work in progress, and this README will include things you can use with the tool. When projct is completed, or safe to use in a scale then a version number will be added to this project. V0.1 will probably be very primitive and won't handle enterprise level configuration. However, I intended to make this tool usable in any scale. So keep an eye for version 1.
